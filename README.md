# tic-tac-toe-py
by andrcggl and orlandoqueb

Project for studying and testing Python and Git
functionalities.

So far we provide Python implementations of simple
TicTacToe and the general m,n,k-game
(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M,n,k-game).

It is possible to play with another human oponent or
against a couple very simple algorithms, the easiest
one being a random move generator.

Further improvements we are seeking to add include
more sophisticated AI oponents, internet playing,
Gomoku and Pente specific rules, as well as general
polish.
